<br><b>1.2a - Conduct Expected of All Players</b>
<br><br>		
All players are expected to play in the spirit of the game by:
<br>
<p>Acting with integrity – for example, by following the Rules,
applying all penalties, and being honest in all aspects of play.</p>
<p>Showing consideration to others - for example,by playing at a prompt pace, looking out for the safety of others, and not distracting the play of another player.</p>
<p>Taking good care of the course – for example, by replacing divots, smoothing bunkers, repairing ball-marks, and not causing unnecessary damage to the course.</p>

- A reminder of R&ampA rule 5.6 - Standards of Player Conduct
<br><br>
<b>5.6b - Prompt Pace of Play</b>
<p>A round of golf is meant to be played at a prompt pace.</p>

<p>Each player should recognise that his or her pace of play is likely to affect how long it will take other players to play their rounds, including both those in the player’s own group and those in following groups.</p>

<p>Players are encouraged to allow faster groups to play through.</p>
(1) - Pace of Play Recommendations. 
<br><br>The player should play at a prompt pace throughout the round, including the time taken to:
<p> - Prepare for and make each stroke,
<br> - Move from one place to another between strokes, and
<br> - Move to the next teeing area after completing a hole.
<br> - A player should prepare in advance for the next stroke and be ready to play when it is his or her turn.
<br>
<br>When it is the player’s turn to play:
<br>
<p>It is recommended that the player make the stroke in no more than 40 seconds after he or she is (or should be) able to play without interference or distraction, and
<br>The player should usually be able to play more quickly than that and is encouraged to do so.</p>
<p>(2) - Playing Out of Turn to Help Pace of Play. Depending on the form of play, there are times when players may play out of turn to help the pace of play:</p>
<p>In match play, the players may agree that one of them will play out of turn to save time (see Rule 6.4a).
In stroke play, players may play “ready golf” in a safe and responsible way (see Rule 6.4b Exception).</p>
<p>(3) - Committee Pace of Play Policy. To encourage and enforce prompt play, the Committee should adopt a Local Rule setting a Pace of Play Policy.</p>
<p>This Policy may set a maximum time to complete a round, a hole or series of holes and a stroke, and it may set penalties for not following the Policy.</p>
<p>See Committee Procedures, Section 5G (recommendations on contents of Pace of Play Policy).</p>
