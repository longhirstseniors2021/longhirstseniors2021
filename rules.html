	<br>- A reminder of R&ampA rule 1.2 - Standards of Player Conduct
<br>
<br>1.2a - Conduct Expected of All Players
<br><br>		
All players are expected to play in the spirit of the game by:
<br>
<p>Acting with integrity – for example, by following the Rules,
applying all penalties, and being honest in all aspects of play.</p>
<p>Showing consideration to others - for example,
by playing at a prompt pace, looking out for the safety of others, and not distracting the play of another player.</p>
<p>Taking good care of the course – for example, by replacing divots, smoothing bunkers, repairing ball-marks, and not causing unnecessary damage to the course.</p>

 Seniors Winter Rules
 <br>
        <br>- preferred lies in the "general area".<br>
        <br>- tees and mats can be used in the "general area" as close as is practical to where the ball lies, but not nearer the hole.<br>
        <br>- free relief from any standing water (or ice/snow ?), as close as is practical to where the ball lies but not nearer hole.<br>
        <br>- drivers not to be used after the initial tee shot.<br>
        <br>- bunkers not in play. Relief to be taken within one club length behind the bunker in an extended  direct line between the flag and where the ball was lying in the bunker.<br>
